This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to styling HTML elements.  The `bug.html` file contains code that sets an element's display property to "none" and then attempts to override its style with a different style attribute. This sequence can lead to the element remaining invisible even after the second style change. The `bugSolution.html` file shows how to correct the issue by setting the attributes in the correct sequence.
